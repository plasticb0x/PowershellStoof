# Powershell Stoof

A collection of various useful powershell scripts to be used for the good of mankind. Srsly. Not for use in anything bad.

## PS-FSBang v0.2

With a provided list of servers, will iterate through all visible, non-default file network shares and pull back all the accessible filepaths therein.

## PS-StringThing v0.0 - In Progress

Parses files from a list of file paths (*cough*FSBang*cough*) to see if it can locate files with a particular regex string. Originally was just going to be a PII searcher but decided to generlize it more.
