# Powershell Stoof

A collection of various useful powershell scripts to be used for the good of mankind. Srsly. Not for use in anything bad.

## PS-FSBang v0.1

Tries to recursively pull back all the file paths from a defined starting directory. Takes around ~28 seconds to return 360,000+ file paths on test machine. Great for feeding into other scripts... File Parsing anyone?

## PS-SSFind v0.0 - In Progress

Parses files from a list of file paths (*cough*FSBang*cough*) to see if it can locate files with SS#'s in it. Then you can tell the rest of your security team why they're worrying about dumb things, but with DATA!
